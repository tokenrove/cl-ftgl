This is a quick CL binding for FTGL, nothing special.  As I use it in
my own projects, I may start to develop some lispier enhancements to
the interface.  The example is a quick conversion of the original
c-demo, and requires cl-opengl to run.  The included font is Aurulent
Sans Regular by Stephen Hartke which is released under the Open Font
License.
